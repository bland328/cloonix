Howto use a cisco with cloonix.

1) Qcow2 cisco creation from an iso.

The goal of this chapter is to create a csr1000v qcow2 that has the following
requirements:

- The command "show license udi" must always give the same result in case a
  paid licence is used with this cisco. The licence is lost if this identifier
  changes.

- The cisco is configured with an interface with DHCP in order to be able to
  have an administrative ip managed by the cloonix nat object.

- The cisco must have ssh and scp and an associated rsa key to be accessed
  without the need for a password.
  This permits the cloonix commands cloonix_osh and cloonix_ocp to work, those
  are the equivalent for a cisco vm of cloonix_ssh and cloonix_scp.

- The mac addresses of the interfaces must not be memorised because a dose of
  random must be put into those mac addresses at VM creation, this in order
  to use the same qcow2 for multiple instances of the cisco without having
  identical macs on a lan.

For all these requirement, we use a very usefull function of the cisco: the
passing of an iso at the launch of the cisco. In this iso is the file
"iosxe_config.txt" containing the pre-configuration that implements the
requirements above, csr is the name for ssh, the cloonix public key
id_rsa.pub is put in the authorized keys of the cisco, and DHCP is 
configured for eth0 of the cisco.

./step1_make_preconf_iso.sh is the command that creates this preconfig iso.

When this iso is done then the creation of the qcow2 can begin (if you have a
csr1000v installation iso such as: csr1000v-universalk9.16.09.01.iso).
This creation is done in 2 steps, beware that in the first step YOU MUST 
CHOOSE THE SERIAL OPTION as cisco access at cisco installation.
 
./step2_make_qcow2.sh is the command that creates cisco.qcow2 in bulk.


Then call ./step3_run_demo.sh and wait until the pings go through. 
 
The cisco has no spice desktop, the  "dtach console" in the cloonix gui or
use the cli command "cloonix_dta nemo cisco1" to access the serial console.
Be aware that Ctrl-C in the dtach console kills the qemu process and thus
kills your virtual cisco machine.

The best is never to use the dtach console but use the cloonix_osh and
cloonix_ocp in the following way:

cloonix_osh nemo cisco1
cloonix_osh nemo cisco1 show ip interface brief
cloonix_ocp nemo cisco1:running-config /tmp/cur_run
cloonix_ocp nemo /tmp/cur_run cisco1:running-config

A double click while over the cisco gives the same as "cloonix_osh nemo cisco1"
Note that the cisco stays red because the blue color comes only when an agent
in the virtual machine responds to cloonix server.
