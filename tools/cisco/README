From a cisco iso to a running ospf network.

First install cloonix if it is not done.

Then get an ios from cisco, I found one on the web at:

http://185.136.162.5/CSR1000v/csr1000v-universalk9.16.09.01.iso

Then adapt the CISCO_ISO variable in the step1_make_qcow2.sh file.
 
Then call ./step1_make_qcow2.sh and choose "Serial Console"
Note that the serial console in cloonix is the dtach console in cloonix menu.

./step1_make_qcow2.sh creates the cisco qcow2.

Then call ./step2_make_iso.sh, this creates an iso file that contains the cisco
initial configuration, this initial configuration allows to inject a custom
configuration latter on.

Then call ./step3_run_demo.sh and wait until the pings go through.
